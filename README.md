This application is meant for all browsers and resizes correctly to fit different browsers and devices. 

### API
I used the API API-Football, https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-football.

### Visualizations
The visualizations is used where charts created using Chart.js and also the creation of two tables.

### JS Libraries
My project uses Chart.js to create the charts used in the comparison page.

### CSS Frameworks & Versions
Bootstrap framwork for CSS and CSS3.

### Project Solution
My project is creating a single location to directly compare stats between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.

My project does not say who is better (does probely  has personal bias though) it always the user to come to their own conclusion.

### Test Code Folder 
You can view practice code in which I used to test features that I either did utilize in final project or not. 

### Script.js
Script.js has the code I would have used if I did not run out of API calls. There are comments in the code to show that I understand how to make API calls and push that data into list.
